## Proposed level of Achievement:
> Apollo 11

## Motivation
> Back in high school days, both of us felt that aside from going through all the context in textbooks, practising questions is an excellent way to seize each chapterâ€™s main point. However, for talented Taiwanese students who pursue further understanding, it is often time-consuming to find relevant resources with clear explanations and well-designed questions. Therefore, our friends and we have formed a team to ameliorate the situation. We have published several study notes, answers to unanswered problems from each high school and science-related articles. Moreover, we aim to provide a platform for Taiwanese students, parents, and teachers to interact. Most of the resources will be complimentary, but we will charge a small amount for users who wish to access our full notes.

## Aim
> Build a website that collaborates with different education-related resources for talented high school students, including practice questions, forum discussion, note sharing, etc.
 
## User Stories
1. As a student asking questions on the forum, I want to be able to receive instant replies. 
2. As a student practising questions, I want to get access to practice more questions. 
3. As a student, I want to acquire further knowledge of advanced topics.
4. As a user viewing this website, I want to obtain the latest information that may be beneficial to me or my kids. 
5. As a teacher, I want to make use of the resources on the website and discuss with other teachers.

## Scope of Project
We wish to build an educational platform with login features--TWeduElite. The platform(website) provides three main features: note sharing, practicing exercises, forum for discussion.

### Features to be completed by the end of June (milestone 2)
- Log in system
- An email form for users to subscribe
- Latest News
- Forum
- Introduction of our study notes
- Other basic features(weekly exercises, related links)

### Features to be completed by the end of July:
- Website styling (colors)
- EXP system
Provide a reward system for users to quantify their contribution on forums and articles. 
- Testing and debugging

## How are we different from similar platforms? 
1. [Snapask](https://snapask.com/zh-tw/) <br />
  - Users can discuss with more than one users.
  - Our forum is free.
2. [Super Think](https://superthink.org/) <br />
  - We provide spaces for users to discuss, instead of only receiving information.
3. Popular Forum (Stack Overflow, ...) <br />
  - Our platform is specially for Taiwanese high school students and their parents/teachers. These users can obtain information more easily in our platform.
