# TWeduElite
# Orbital 2021
## Proposed level of Achievement:
> Apollo 11
## Motivation
> Back in high school days, both of us felt that aside from going through all the context in textbooks, practising questions is an excellent way to seize each chapterâ€™s main point. However, for talented Taiwanese students who pursue further understanding, it is often time-consuming to find relevant resources with clear explanations and well-designed questions. Therefore, our friends and we have formed a team to ameliorate the situation. We have published several study notes, answers to unanswered problems from each high school and science-related articles. Moreover, we aim to provide a platform for Taiwanese students, parents, and teachers to interact. Most of the resources will be complimentary, but we will charge a small amount for users who wish to access our full notes.
## Aim
> Build a website that collaborates with different education-related resources for talented high school students, including advanced topics, practice questions, forum discussion, note sharing, etc. 
## User Stories
1. As a student asking questions on the forum, I want to be able to receive instant replies. 
2. As a student practising questions, I want to practice specific questions to ensure I have no problem with specific topics. 
3. As a student, I want to acquire further knowledge of advanced topics.
4. As a student logging in to the website, I want to ensure that my data has been well protected. 
5. As a parent viewing this website, I want to obtain the latest information that may be beneficial to my kids. 
6. As a teacher, I want to make use of the resources on the website and discuss with other teachers.

## How are we different from similar platforms? 
1. Snapask/Super Think
We hope that users can have a good experience while visiting the website, therefore the interface design and the latest update of news or exercises (once a week) will be provided. 
2. Advanced topic/Forum
Targeting for specific groups and providing related resources. We also provide a shopping system for users to sell or buy notes on this platform, which makes it become a duo directional output website and can increase the activity level.
