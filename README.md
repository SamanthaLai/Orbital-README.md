# TWeduElite
# Orbital 2021
## Proposed level of Achievement:
Apollo 11

## Motivation
Back in high school days, both of us felt that aside from going through all the context in textbooks, practising questions is an excellent way to seize each chapterâ€™s main point. However, for talented Taiwanese students who pursue further understanding, it is often time-consuming to find relevant resources with clear explanations and well-designed questions. Therefore, our friends and we have formed a team to ameliorate the situation. We have published several study notes, answers to unanswered problems from each high school and science-related articles. Moreover, we aim to provide a platform for Taiwanese students, parents, and teachers to interact. Most of the resources will be complimentary, but we will charge a small amount for users who wish to access our full notes.

## Aim
Build a website that collaborates with different education-related resources for talented high school students, including practice questions, forum discussion, note sharing, etc.
 
## User Stories
1. As a student asking questions on the forum, I want to be able to receive instant replies.
2. As a student practising questions, I want to get access to the answers and more questions.
3. As a student, I want to acquire further knowledge of advanced topics.
4. As a user viewing this website, I want to obtain the latest information that may be beneficial to me or my kids. 
5. As a user aiming to get admission to special class (e.g., science class), I want to gather all the related information without browsing too many websites.
6. As a teacher, I want to make use of the resources on the website and discuss with other teachers.

## Scope of Project
We wish to build an educational platform with login features--TWeduElite. The platform(website) provides three main features: note sharing, practicing exercises, forum for discussion.

### Features completed by the end of June (milestone 2)
- Log in system
- An email form for users to subscribe
- Latest News
- Study note
- Weekly exercise
- Related links (to other websites related to our platform)
- Forum (only the interface so far)

### Features to be completed by the end of July (milestone 3):
- Before early-July
  - Forum
  - User profile page
- Before mid-July
  - Website styling (colors, font, UI/UX)
- Before the end of July
  - Testing and debugging
  - (If time permits) EXP system
    - Provide a reward system for users to quantify their contribution on forums and articles. 

### Roadblocks of our features / solution we encountered
- User system
  - The default Django user model is not sufficient for us. There are several ways to extend the model, but not all of them can be used in our situation.
  - We choose to add some fields to our extended user model (e.g., wish to get latest news from us via email or not), and add other information to other model (e.g., user picture to profile model)
- Media files will get lost in heroku app
  - This is because the ephemeral design of heroku.
  - We decide to use other saving platform like Amazon S3 or Cloudinary to save the media files.
- Several smaller issues related to Django. Most of them are related to url parameters, models creation and querying and filtering data. They have been solved.

## Technology/framework used
- Adobe XD (UI)
- Bulma (CSS Framework)
  - A modern CSS framework base on flexbox.
  - 100% CSS, which implies that it can be used with almost all JS frameworks.
- Vue.JS (frontend)
  - A progressive light-weight JS framework.
- Django (backend)
  - A well-development high level backend framework written in Python.
  - By using Django, we can build our website in an structured way.
- PostgreSQL (database)
- Heroku (Cloud platform)
  - Used to deploy our website.
  - Support Django.
  - It's free plan is sufficient for us.

## Planned testing schedule / detail
- Before early-July
  - Self test the features we have proposed by Django test.
  - We will also test the features by creating an actual account and using all the features.
  - Also, we will discuss with other five team members. They are not part of the orbital team, but we worked together on making/publishing our books for over one year. 
- Before mid-July
  - We will create a google form and provide them to potential users. Our facebook page has over 2,500 subscribers so far, and over 200 users have bought our books. We hope to get sufficient data and suggestions from our customers.
- Before milestone 3
  - We will adjust our website / testing method according to the feedbacks.

## How are we different from similar platforms? 
1. [Snapask](https://snapask.com/zh-tw/) <br />
  - Users can discuss with more than one users, instead of only one random tutor.
  - Our forum page is free.
2. [Super Think](https://superthink.org/) <br />
  - We provide spaces for users to discuss, instead of only receiving information.
3. Popular Forum (Stack Overflow, ...) <br />
  - Our platform is specially for Taiwanese high school students and their parents/teachers. These users can obtain information more easily in our platform.
